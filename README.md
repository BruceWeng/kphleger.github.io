IE590 Homework 1

"main HTML content"
	wrote the content for index.html and put in some placeholder CSS work
	
"external style sheet"
	changed header to use an external style sheet. Code is currently "copy-pasted", and will be revised as necessary to remove unused information.
	
"styling changes"
	added many styling elements to styleSheet.css, and removed the <meta> tag since I don't need the page searchable.
