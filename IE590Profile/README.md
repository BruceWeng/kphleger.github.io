IE590 Homework 1

"main HTML content"
	wrote the content for index.html and put in some placeholder CSS work
	
"external style sheet"
	changed header to use an external style sheet. Code is currently "copy-pasted", and will be revised as necessary to remove unused information.
	
"styling changes"
	added many styling elements to styleSheet.css, and removed the <meta> tag since I don't need the page searchable.
	
"background and style"
	added a background and fixed the resulting table readability issues. Also made minor changes to header style and margins.
	
"links and so much more"
	added a second page with identical information, but different styling. Altered the first page colors.
	Note the use of a hex value for one of the colors, and referencing the text at the bottom not by its tag, but by its ID.
